# Specifications

### Operationalise fNIRS Equipment

1. Development of procedure manual for setup and calibration of the LUMO device
2. Integrate fNIRS timestamping into Compumedics
3. Produce fNIRS analysis pipelines for spreadsheet export including Total \(HbT\), Deoxygenated \(HbR\) and Oxygenated \(HbO\) Haemoglobin for all channels
4. Embed fNIRS signals into EDF files exported from Compumedics to allow time-view of all PSG and fNIRS signals on Compumedics Profusion
5. Integrate fNIRS timestamping to allow assessment during neurobehavioral test batteries
6. Produce fNIRS head maps to show local functional hyperaemia with changes in HbO, HbR and HbT in response to tasks during neurobehavioral testing.
